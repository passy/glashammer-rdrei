Introduction
============

Glashammer is simply a web application development framework. Yes, yet
another one. Glashammer has lofty goals. Firstly something simple such as "hello
world" should be very simple, yet adding extra ready-components (such as an
admin interface) should also be very easy, and thus, batteries are very much
included.

Unlike a framework like Django, Glashammer is built using various proven
components. However, unlike a framework like Pylons, Glashammer decides what is
best for you in a number of situations. Choice is a great thing, and replacement
components are easy to add/replace, but the default configuration is complete.

Features:

* WSGI (but no WSGI knowledge needed)
* Painfully explicit
* Reusable components
* Form integration
* Database Integration
* Auth out of the box
* Admin interface for application management
* Template integration
