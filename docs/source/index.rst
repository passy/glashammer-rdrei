Glashammer User Manual
======================

Welcome to the Glashammer documentation.

Glashammer is simply a Python web application development framework. Yes, yet
another one. Glashammer has lofty goals. Firstly something simple such as
"hello world" should be very simple, yet adding extra ready-components (such
as an admin interface) should also be very easy, and thus, batteries are very
much included.

Please select an item from the contents below. The introduction is a good place
