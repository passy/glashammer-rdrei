    textpress.database
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    This module is a rather complex layer on top of SQLAlchemy 0.4 or higher.
    Basically you will never use the `textpress.database` module except you
    are a core developer, but always use the high level `db` module which you
    can import from the `textpress.api` module.

    The following examples all assume that you have imported the db module.

    Foreword
    --------

    One important thing is that this module does some things in the background
    you don't have to care about in the modules.  For example it fetches a
    database connection and session automatically.  There are also some
    wrappers around the normal sqlalchemy module functions.

    What you have to know is that the `textpress.api.db` module contains all
    the public objects from `sqlalchemy` and `sqlalchemy.orm`.  Additionally
    there are the following functions:

    `db.get_engine`
        return the engine object for the current application. This is
        equivalent with `get_application().database_engine`.

    `flush`
        flush all outstanding database changes in the current session.

    `mapper`
        replacement for the normal SQLAlchemy mapper function. Works the
        same but users our `ManagerExtension`.  See the notes below.

    `save`
        bind an unbound object to the session and mark it for saving.
        Normally models you create by hand are automatically saved, unless
        you create it with ``_tp_no_save=True``

    `DatabaseManager`
        baseclass for all the database managers.  If you don't set at least
        one database manager to your model TextPress will create one for
        you called `objects`.


    Definiting Tables
    -----------------

    So let's get started quickly.  To defin tables all you have to do is to
    create a metadata instances for your table collection (so that you can
    create them) and bind some tables to it::

        metadata = db.MetaData()

        my_table = db.Table('my_plugin_my_table', metadata,
            db.Column('my_table_id', db.Integer, primary_key=True),
            ...
        )


    Creating a Upgrade Function
    ---------------------------

    If you want to use those tables in a TextPress plugin you have to create
    them.  You have to register a database upgrade function (see the
    docstrings on the application object regarding taht) which looks like
    this::

        def upgrade_database(app):
            metadata.create_all(app.database_engine)


    Writing Models
    --------------

    If you want to map your tables to classes you have to write some tables.
    This works exactly like mentioned in the excellent SQLAlchemy
    documentation, except that all the functions and objects you want to use
    are stored in the `db` module.

    For some example models have a look at the `textpress.models` module.

    One difference to plain SQLAlchemy is that we don't use a normal session
    context that sets a query object to models, but we use a technique similar
    to django's models, which they call `DatabaseManagers`.

    Basically what happens is that after the `mapper()` call, TextPress checks
    your models and looks for `DatabaseManager` instances.  If it cannot find
    at least one it will create a standard database managed on the attribute
    called `objects`.  If that attribute is already in used it will complain
    and raise an exception.

    You can of course bind multiple database managers to one model.  But now
    what are `DatabaseManagers`?

    Say you have a model but the queries in the views are quite complex.  So
    you can write functions that fire that requests somewhere else.  But where
    to put those queries?  Per default all query methods are stored an a
    database manager and it's a good idea to keep them there.  If you want to
    add some more methods to a manager just subclass `db.DatabaseManager` and
    instanciate them on your model::

        class UserManager(db.DatabaseManager):

            def get_authors(self):
                return self.select(User.role >= ROLE_AUTHOR)

        class User(object):
            objects = UserManager()
            ...

    Now you can get all the authors by calling `User.objects.get_authors()`.
    The object returned is a normal SQLAlchemy queryset so you can easily
    filter that using the normal query methods.


    Querying
    --------

    How to query? Just use the database manager attached to an object.  If
    you haven't attached on yourself the default `DatabaseManager` is mounted
    on the model as `objects`.  See the `DatabaseManager` docstring for more
    details.

    If you have to fire up some more raw and complex queries that don't use
    the mapper, get yourself a engine object using `get_engine` and start
    playing with it :-)  For normal execution you however don't have to do
    this, you can use `db.execute`, `db.begin` etc. which is also the
    preferred way since it takes place in the current session.


    Deleting Objects
    ----------------

    To delete objects you have to call `db.delete(obj)` and flush the session.


    Final Words
    -----------

    If you're lost, check out existing modules. Especially the views and
    the `models` modules of the core and existing plugins.
